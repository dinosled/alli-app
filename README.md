# About

## Alli-App, made to support people during the process of abortion with pills

Alli-App offers daily information and guidance on taking medication, managing potential side effects, and ensuring a safe and comfortable experience during the process of abortion with pills.

We understand the importance of having a low-barrier, diversity-aware, and gender-inclusive platform that serves the needs of our diverse target audience. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and inclusive app that supports individuals through every step of the process.

We are currently in the development stage. If you want to join our mission to make abortion with pills a more accessible and empowering experience reach out to us at team@alli-app.com. For more information check out our [website](https://alli-app.com/).
